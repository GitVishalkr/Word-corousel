/*
why is 0% and 100% identical ?
In CSS animations, when the first and last keyframes (0% and 100%) are identical, it creates a seamless transition. This is because the animation effectively loops back to its starting point without any abrupt changes. When the animation reaches 100%, it smoothly transitions back to 0% without any visible snapping or jump.

Interpolation: CSS animations work by interpolating values between keyframes. If the end value (100%) is different from the start value (0%), the browser must perform a sudden change when looping, which can create a noticeable snap.

Without Matching Keyframes: If you were to change the content at 100% to something different (e.g., ' finished'), the animation would snap back to ' coding' upon completion, creating a jarring effect.
